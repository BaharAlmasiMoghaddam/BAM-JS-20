/*
   what is the difference between an asynchronous function and a synchronous function?
*/

// ! Answer!âš¡

/*
   asynchronous =
      allows tasks to start and finish independently, while one of them is waiting, others can run. 
   
   Synchronous =
      executes tasks one by one. each one waits for the previous one to complete before starting. like a noon barbari queue :)
